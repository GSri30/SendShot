Ever got into a situation where you couldn't take a picture of your laptop screen using your mobile?

This might help you!

- Take a screenshot
- Thats it!
- It will automatically DM you that screenshot (Currently this uses discord webhook but can be extended to slack etc)

As simple as that!

How about having a GUI to start this application?
